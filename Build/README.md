# PlayerAvatarLoader v1.1.1
### Uses ModelReplacementAPI to load a number of unique models for each player. I can best be contacted on discord if needed at notaustin69 (NotAustin)

## Features
- Allows each player to have up to 4 unique models (1 for each vanilla suit).
- 4 default avatars are for anyone who does not have a unique asset bundle or for any suits someone's bundle does not have.
  - Orange suit: Goku (Xenoverse 2)
  - Green suit: WarGreymon (Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth)
  - Hazard suit: Burger King (Sneak King)
  - Pajama suit: Freddy (Five Nights at Freddy's: Help Wanted)
- Works with More_Suits to remove the limit of 4 models. To use, edit this mod's config file to include ALL of the additional suit names you have loaded.
